# Basic concepts

Omeka S is a database for storing collections of items which
have relationships to one another, and which can have more than one
media attached to them.

Once you've built a collection of resources, you can publish some or
all of them as a website. By default you get a single page for an item,
with embedded multimedia, but there are a range of other ways to present
resources - as a timeline, a network graph or on a map.

This is a short introduction, and it's also a test of what we're going to
turn into a half-day workshop, so I'll only be covering a few of Omeka S'
features:

* uploading a CSV file to create sets of items
* data cleaning to keep Omeka S happy
* automatically creating links between items
* publishing items on a map

Because we've only got an hour, it's more a walkthrough than an interactive
demo. We should have time for questions and interruptions.
