# Basic concepts

Omeka S is a database for storing collections of items which
have relationships to one another, and which can have more than one
media attached to them.

Once you've built a collection of resources, you can publish some or
all of them as a website. By default you get a single page for an item,
with embedded multimedia, but there are a range of other ways to present
resources - as a timeline, a network graph or on a map.

This is a short introduction which only covers a few of Omeka S' features:

* How to import a spreadsheet with your items
* Some points about data hygiene to keep Omeka S' import module happy 
* Creating links between items
* Publishing items on a map

We should have time for questions and interruptions.
