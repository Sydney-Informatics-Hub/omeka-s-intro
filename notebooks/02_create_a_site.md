# Create a site

We create a site by selecting the "Sites" item in the navigation panel,
and then clicking the "Add new site" in the top right.

A site needs a title (fields which are mandatory in Omeka are marked with
a red asterisk).

You can also define the "URL slug" - this becomes part of the site's URL.
If you leave this blank, Omeka will create one from your title.

Once you've created it, you should see your site's title in the navigation
panel. You can visit the site by clicking the little square icon next
to the title: this will take you to an empty site, as we haven't added
any resources to it yet.
