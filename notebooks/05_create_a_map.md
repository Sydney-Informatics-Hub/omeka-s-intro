# Create a map


We're going to add a new page with a map showing all of the resources
we've just imported

Click Pages in the left nav panel, then click "Add new page"

Like the site as a whole, the page needs to have a title, and the URL
slug can be customised but usually will just be the title.

The page editor looks like this:

A page is a series of "blocks", each of which is a view of some or all
of the resources behind a site.

We're going to add one block to this - "Map by query"

The "Map by query" has a lot of details in it - we can leave the defaults
for now

Click the "Save" button in the top left hand corner
