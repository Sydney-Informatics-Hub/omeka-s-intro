# Site navigation

For our page to be available to users, we need to add it to the
site's navigation

Click on the "Navigation" item in the site's panel on the left  - this
is where we build up a list of pages which will be linked across the
top of the site.

The page we've just created, Map, is available on the right hand side,
under "Add a link to a site page". Clicking on "Map" will add  it to the
central pane

The site also comes with a default page called "welcome"

The Navigation page also lets us pick a "Home page" - this is the page
which a visitor will see when they first arrive at the site.

Once you're finished, click "Save"

If you follow the icon next to the site, we can now see the Map as
our site's homepage.
